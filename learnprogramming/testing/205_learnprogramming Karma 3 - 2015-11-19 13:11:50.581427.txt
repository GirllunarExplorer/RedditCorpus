hey everyone bored decided screw around c make linked list issue print list top always end extra null struct printed end assuming structured thing really poorly allocating space decide whether even need code commented section replace bit code wrapped slashes obviously fixes issue check stop even allocating space way wanted see handle issue like trying free space setting null obviously working understand probably avoid way completely like understand freeing space setting null enough printing happens hit one print null still printing empty struct maybe freeing wrong memory really seeing screwing include stdioh include stdlibh include stringh struct mylink int id char name struct mylink next struct mylink prev int main int listcount variable assign id order starting struct mylink head struct mylink tail struct mylink walkhead tail walker head null tail nullset null initially head mallocsizeofstruct mylinkallocate space head headprev null headnext null walk headstart walker head char temptemp string allocating memory string structs scanfstempscan string walkname mallocsizeoftempallocate string memory strcpywalknametempset string walkid listcountset structure id current listcount increment listcount tail headset tail head walknext null whilewalknexti move ifstrcmp avoid allocating space completely need understand working struct mylink setprev char temp chunk working chunk scanfstemp ifstrcmptempstop tail setprev works never allocate space first place freewalk walk null break chunk working block setprev walk walknext mallocsizeofstruct mylinkassuming error allocating filling walk walknext walknext null walkprev setprev broken chunk code char temp scanfstemp ifstrcmptempstop tail setprevbut dealocate space set null idk working freewalk walk null break broken chunk walkname mallocsizeoftemp strcpywalknametemp walkid listcount printfprinting normal nown walk head whilewalk printfd name list dnwalkidwalknamelistcount walk walknext printfbackwards nown walk tail whilewalk printfd name list dnwalkidwalknamelistcount walk walkprev return
