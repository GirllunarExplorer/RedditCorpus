common misconception computer science equals programming truth cs problem solving important part problem solving algorithms data structures hope introduce examples data structures algorithms path finding finding path common use gps using tool implements path finding algorithm visual path finding algorithms put one dot way top left corner another dot bottom right corner dots opposite corners fastest algorithm bestfirstsearch algorithm pretty damn slow however dots closer algorithm pretty fast matter algorithm slow far distance fast shorter distance matters sometimes need check far distances sometimes path short use example another thing fastest algorithm might hardest longest implement lot times sacrifice algorithm run time order solve problem faster path finding one branch algorithms turn makes big part cs sorting use google google search returns list web pages hierarchical list based scoring system closely match search criteria closest match downwards achieved sort sorting algorithm sorting algorithms sort equally notice much slower others trees one famous trees bst bst awesome tree allows something really fascinating implements binary search binary search common think looking word dictionary ' open dictionary ' well know go left open ' go right eventually find word horse imagine started letter ' went page page get page ' located trees excellent way holding data hash tables hash tables hash tables interesting let store things according hash function know piggy banks dump bunch coins get stored according pennies dimes nickels quarters well kinda like hash table lets say four different coins penny dime nickel quarters coins get ' hash function specific location pennies stored penny slots dimes get stored dime slots etc new coin go respective slots another example storing passwords deeper security measures involved basically authentication system built hash table first hash function converts password address hash table stores password table basic level lets say using hash function password ' equals well ' gets stored table rd position user goes login password ' check see value table access granted conclusion many many kinds data structures algorithms covering take eternity figured start couple although cs far data structures algorithms extremely vital part data structures algorithms toolsbuilding blocks use solve problems implement data structures algorithms using programming languages cs involves programming way express kinds things remember cs programming cs problem solving examples tools use solving problems list common data structures algorithms visit following list data structures algorithms edit people pointed coming across saying programming important excellent programmer cs mean say cs study programming mean programming entirety cs fact data structures algorithms even entirety cs university take two semesters classes cover dsa involves programming kind things talk need competent programmer get cs cs learn programming programming one tools use learn cs
