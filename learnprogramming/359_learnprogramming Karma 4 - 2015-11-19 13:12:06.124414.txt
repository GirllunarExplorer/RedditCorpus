kind weird ivory towersolo developer really sure specific question think might need perspective work know anyone really go talk sort thing really know cleanly summarize nice little paragraph two try bear please describe current situation really belong hereor better place goplease let know really sure best place go background formal education programming pretty much entirely selftaught selfteaching things early rememberespecially comes computers technology started dabbling programming well scripting really around years old learned concepts fundamentals programming pretty early age continued dabbling multitude different scriptingprogramming languages ever since years never really worked significant projects undertakings two years ago situation background year half ago team starting piloting new programinitiative intent eventually going companywide next twothree years software solution using webbased saas help assist managing information inputtransformationoutput far complicated intuitive use way bulk importing different data sap needed use months working thirdparty saas solution people facility piloting pretty much enough process methodology behind sound system complicated userfriendly already stuff time flatout dont time need invest learn system going offline around time started little sideproject work created kind proofofconcept application excel vbauserforms using data already extracting spreadsheets alternate solutiontemporary measure use mostly functional pitched manager loved gave goahead make project priority finish basicminimumrequired features capabilities tool renew contract saas hated additional months next year process continued change order make efficient easier apply features capabilities scope little poc program continued grow grow grow made lot mistakesespecially beginningthat come regret next year learned bettereasiermoreadaptable concepts ideas used gotten point quite limited excelvba foundation gotten major kinks ironed process looking transitioning standalone program dedicated sql database department severely stressed right recently announced cutting positions north america end inhouse teams able much help us aside setting sql server beginning year looked two thirdparty developer contractors company worked past createdevelop specific programs us first estimate came back k second bit k neither team budget considerable pressure upper echelon roll two additional facilities q really scale excelbased version tool excelbased version tool effective initial piloting process quite regular frequency altered tweaked process changed underlying data structure used added new things removed others etc allowed us adapt quite easily pretty significant changes processdata sourcesdata structure needed ensure made tool fit process instead compromising effectiveness process order make fit within scope tool last months february year started looking creating standalone program vbnet spent month familiarizing visual studio difference languagesyntaxoperators coming vba full vbnet framework new different winform controls properties events spent six weeks working side project able create significant portion vbnet pulling specified data database dataset populating treeview structure using data using data multiple tables format specific treeview nodes differently based certain criteria backgroundworker thread using invokes treeviewnodes things considered pretty damn proud things unsure unsure implement amount work complexity involved etc coming vbnet things able implement working functionality earlystage version cases least able create proofofconcept test using assemblyobjectsmethodsetc need use something things fully explored implementing relatively minor compared things unsure first point say confidence able develop full standalone tool visual studiovbnet brings us present found hesitant going forward secondguessing almost afraid afraid probably strong word hesitant anxious worried sure describe think afraid essentially end making kind mistake made earlier stages excelbased tool despite knowledge skills grown since first started whole vbnet languageframework work worried make kinds mistakes eg writing implementing things certain way way know accomplish trying inexperience vbnet framework ill fail foresee future complication create end come back six nine months rewriterefactor ton code order right way cursing blissfully ignorant past self repay technical debt racked exactly like ended excelbased version mean know making exact mistakesin fact really looking forward able use freshstart order lot core things wish done first wrote excelbased versionbut feel like position analogous minimum requisite skillsknowledge needed accomplish set right precipice diving going last time though diving small lake wasnt worried pick didnt know yet went possibilities full vbnet stack offers contrast vba time feel standing shores ocean least one great lakes find much acutely aware fact know much know know use google msdn developer references stackoverflow matter knowing tools available use question knowing use tool one different kinds situations experiencing oftendescribed valley despair heard really sure looking suspect thing really point push forward go guess like get perspective people experience andor similar situation faced sort thing thanks anyone took time read grateful advice insight help offer
