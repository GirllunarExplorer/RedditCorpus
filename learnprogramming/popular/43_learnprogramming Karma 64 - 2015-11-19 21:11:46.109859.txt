today going little different talk one technical aspect game tinykeep interactive demo found dungeon generation demo step step first set number cells want generate say arbitrary amount really higher number larger dungeon general complexity cell spawn rectangle random width length within radius radius matter much probably proportionate number cells instead using uniformly distributed random numbers default mathrandom generator languages using parkmiller normal distribution addition ensure ratio width length cell large want perfectly square rooms neither want really skinny ones somewhere point random cells small area overlapping next use simple separation steering behaviour separate rectangles none overlapping technique ensures cells overlapping yet general remain tightly packed together possible fill gaps x sized cells result end square grid differently sized cells perfectly packed together fun begins determine cells grid rooms cell width height certain threshold made room parkmiller normal distribution described earlier small amount rooms comparison number cells lots space remaining cells still useful however read next stage want link room together begin construct graph center points using delaunay triangulation want every single room linked every corridor make confusing layout construct minimal spanning tree minimal spanning tree looks nice boring dungeon layout contains loops extreme delaunay triangulation reincorporate small number edges triangulated graph say remaining edges minimal spanning tree created final layout therefore graph rooms guaranteed reachable containing loops variety convert graph corridors edge construct series straight lines l shapes going room graph neighbour cells yet used cells grid rooms become useful cells intersect l shapes become corridor tiles variety cell sizes walls corridors twisty uneven perfect dungeon example finished result example screenshot thanks hope guys enjoy algorithm used upcoming d dungeon crawler tinykeep currently development tinykeep d multiplayer dungeon crawler frighteningly intelligent monster ai
