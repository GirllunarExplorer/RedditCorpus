bit background info graduated computer engineering okay amount programming experience playing around android sdk make little game right screen interact draw present press finger screen little explosion consisting many particles works something like class screen everything happens public class maingamepanel extends surfaceview implements surfaceholdercallback private explosion explosions public void update explosioniupdate explosion public class explosion private particle particles public void update particleiupdate particle public class particle private float x y xvelocity yvelocity public void update update x y based xvelocity yvelocity problem want draw border around screen particle bounce border touch first make separate class called border exist within maingamepanel problem know ' place put collisiondetection code natural place particle class particleupdate something like check x y coordinates vs xy coordinates collision reverse xvelocity yvelocity necessary update x y based xvelocity yvelocity need either pass border instance maingamepanelupdate call b keep border instance inside particle class probably static instance since need separate border particle seems kind messy b feel right border part particle alternatively stick code within maingamepanelupdate method looks like public void update explosion particle check x y coordinates vs x y coordinates collision reverse xvelocity yvelocity necessary explosioniupdate explosion approach seems messy much ' objectoriented programming anyone opinion way ' picky general ' way something like problem run time sure people offered good guidelines dealing hard even phrase problem clear way guidelines
