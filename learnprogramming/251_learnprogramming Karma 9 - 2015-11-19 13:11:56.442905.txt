alright honestly tried looking asynchronous functions c results c exclusively get nothing c going ask better already asked questions stackexchange whathaveyou please direct teaching concurrency asynchronous functions attempting create thread pool far still planning phase trying find clear path travel however want handout code want nudge right direction else exercise pointless best way asynchronously return function really ready return almost immediately even currently processing task given user task going callback arguments fit necessary pthreadt arguments needed although work attributes later function returns struct called result contains void return value byte unsigned char called ready hold values result ready user attempt process item yet item null user returns null ready lets user know finished struct result determines whether processed unsigned char ready return type null ready void item struct really complete basic prototype embodying attempting really issue though although let know wrong approach next actually process thing blocking everything finished said function create result asynchronously process return immediately returning result problem asynchronously processing thinking spawning another thread inside threadpool feel missing point thread pool longer remaining simple thinking feeling grossly overcomplicated function addtask spawn new thread thread passed subprocess struct return nonprocessed initialized result spawned thread also spawn another thread see problem thread b original callback arguments join thread thread b capture return value stored item member since result pointing struct user holds problem problem spawns threads instead able wondering wrong complicating things better way library function asynchronously anyway prototype subprocess struct makes easier retype everything typedef void threadcallbackvoid args struct subprocess result processed result result thread callback processed threadcallback cb arguments passed callback void args wrong feeling missing whole point threadpool another question way spawn thread created waiting anything thinking handling creating threads wait processing function called feeling wrong way go edit elaborate also post pseudocode attempting
